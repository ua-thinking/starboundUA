As you will already be aware, there are no 'parent' figures in Floran culture and as such a Greenfinger must act as the tribe's authority figure.\n\nFloran will always respect a Greenfinger that protects their tribe, regardless of their age or experience, for respect among our kind is awarded to those who show strength."
