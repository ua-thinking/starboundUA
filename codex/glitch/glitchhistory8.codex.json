When I eventually did find a willing couple, what I saw was quite fascinating.\n\nParts were procured from a certain shop, the couple picking items and features that \"felt right\"."

Interestingly, the few times I tried to discuss the process after the fact, neither would go beyond stating that \"They had a very nice time\"."
