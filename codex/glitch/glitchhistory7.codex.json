Though, unsurprisingly, their process of digestion differs greatly.\n\nWhen the Glitch eat, food  is collected in the body and broken down by bacteria. As the food ferments, methane gas is released and collected.\n\nThe methane is then burnt, and the heat created used to power a gas turbine. As such, each Glitch has his or her own internal combustion engine."
