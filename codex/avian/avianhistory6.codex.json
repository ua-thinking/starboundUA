      "Eng": "Avians of the Kluex faith hold a peculiar religious belief that our kind once had wings capable of flight, much like non-sentient birds. It is a curious thought, one likely born of idealism rather than historical fact. From a biological standpoint, it is not unthinkable that our arms could have evolved from the wings of our ancestors, but not without the passage of a million or more years. It is a curious thought indeed."
