Once it lands it will be taken, and treated, and placed in the tomb stacks, amongst the vessels of my fellow Ascendants.\n\nI can barely take an interest in it. My soul, my essence, my very self will be untethered! Free to soar; to join Kluex \"as part and whole\"! I hear the wind calling me, it is Kluex's voice."

Once the oil is applied, gold dust is brushed through my feathers. It's the gold dust that will make me glitter like the heavens once I get outside amongst the lanterns."
