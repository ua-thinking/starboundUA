Each day we pray and chant, and I am anointed.\n\nI found myself at the altar today, and ran my hand along the blood stains on its surface, so fresh from sacrifices of the recent battle. It was wonderful, the sensation almost electric! The blood of brave warriors, our noble enemies, set aflow to satisfy our mighty and wondrous god. "
