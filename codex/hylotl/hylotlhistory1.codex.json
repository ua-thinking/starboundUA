Our trinocular vision imbues us with superior sensitivity to light and shadow, as a species we are capable of perceiving artistry beyond the grasp of other sentient beings. From our very genesis we were blessed to perceive beauty other races lack the capacity to envisage, and to share this sight is our gift unto them."
