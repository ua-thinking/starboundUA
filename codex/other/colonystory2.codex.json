      "Eng": "In the morning I was greeted by a spectacular view of the sunrise over the dense forest canopy far below. I figured this little shack could be of use to others who find themselves lost in the woods like me, so I set about removing the overgrowth and replacing some rotten beams to fill the gaps in the walls and floors. It quickly became a much larger renovation project, and I took up semi-permanent residence there for a time. That little shack began to feel like a veritable home from home for me, so I decided it deserved a tenant."
