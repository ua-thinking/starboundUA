She believes the Ruin to be a 'cleansing force' that will destroy all 'inferior life' in the universe - that it will leave 'only the worthy intact'. She was talking about humans! She wants to release the Ruin, to aid it!\n\nI tried to reason with her, but she WOULD NOT see sense. Her excitement became rage, incensed by my 'ignorance'. I reached out to her but she pushed me away. I pleaded with her but to no avail. She left. \nMy Asra, my little girl, is gone."

Perhaps a little space and time will settle her.\n\nMy exploration has taken us to a small planet orbiting a remote star - far away from any civilisation, but perhaps closer to the answers I seek. Asra has been a huge help - I hope one day her wits will grow into wisdom."
