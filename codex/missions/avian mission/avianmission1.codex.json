In all my years of marauding I've never come across such fearsome creatures... Though creatures is an inaccurate description of them... They should be inert - formed of stone and crystal as they are - but they seem to live. Are they mindless automata, or does some purpose guide them? I was told stories of golems as a child..."

Today I caught a glimpse of a monstrous individual - fully twice as big as any other I've seen. It slept in a cavernous chamber, dimly lit by gemstones. It's face was that of a bird and its body was adorned with crystal-feathered wings. Perhaps it is their god, Kluex? I could almost believe it, here in the darkness. Maybe it is his avatar. I will leave it to slumber."
