We fled, and the mutants followed.\n\nThe laser cannon was left intact. Perhaps a braver soul could go back and use it to destroy the creature. They would have to be agile enough to dodge its beams, and strong enough to defeat its corrupted lackeys. I just don't have the fight in me anymore."

At first we thought it was a sentient crystal, but a desperate attack with a mining laser cannon uncovered a single, unblinking eye within."
